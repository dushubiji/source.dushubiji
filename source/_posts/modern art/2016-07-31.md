## Constructivism (learning)

It's a philosophy of education about [nature of knowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism), that focuses on how humans make meaning from their experiences. 

> All of us constantly organize and select the information our senses take in from the natural world and from the symbolic and cultural worlds of words and signs. This is how we make sense of these worlds. This activity is independent of any particular educational theory. It’s a consequence of our being human, of our neurological system and the way it develops and interacts with the environment.

> Children are not born with the ability to interpret the world as their elders do. They have to learn the meaning of things and they do so gradually, as they gain experience.
